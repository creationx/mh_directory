# mh_directory
The next step to "mh_branchenbuch"; a TYPO3-Extension

## Features

In the beginning the extension will only have some basic features but i promise that it will be at least have ALL features which mh_branchenbuch has and much more!

General ToDo-List
* Add types for the entries: So you can add different types with different modes for example "Entry S" where the customer can not upload a image or set the link to facebook or twitter and so on ...
* to be continued ...

### LIST-Function

It shows a 3-way-wizard for entries. You can categorize the entries in 3 "location"-groups. Federal States, Administrative Districts and Cities.

#### ToDo
Currently ToDo-List for the List-Function
* Add GoogleMaps
* Add detail-page for entry
* Add broadcrump for navigation

### Backend-Module

All entries can be modified and added in the default backend of TYPO3. I tried to make the forms as much comfortable as possible and hope you like it.

There is also a backend module available but currently it is empty.
